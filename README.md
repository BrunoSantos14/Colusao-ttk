# Colusao-ttk
The Colusao-ttk Proficiency Study Tool is a Python application developed to facilitate the analysis of interactions among participants in proficiency trials. 
The tool utilizes TTK Bootstrap and provides an intuitive interface for efficient data processing and visualization.

# Main Features

  into potential collusion in modules/analytes of the Proficiency Test in rounds within a year.
- User-Friendly Interface: The application has a user-friendly interface, making it easy for analysts to navigate through the study data and interpret the results. It is possible to obtain
  personal characteristics of participant groups to investigate if they belong to the same business group or are from nearby geographical regions, crucial details for decision-making.
- Data Export: Users can export a report for the study's conclusion, making it available to the team directory.
- Customizable Visualization: The tool offers customizable visualizations, enabling users to create informative graphs to better understand the study results.
- When selecting a specific year, the system calculates all possible collusions in all modules/analytes of the Proficiency Test.
